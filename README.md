# erosionDilationImageProcessing
A notebook to explain how erosion and dilation, two of the most used operations in image processing, works.

Erosion and Dilation are two operations widely used in image processing. A lot of other operations (opening, closing, skeleton and so on) use them. 
On "Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods. 2006. Digital Image Processing (3rd Edition). Prentice-Hall, Inc., USA." they are presented in terms of sets, so I decided to implement them using set operations on Python.
